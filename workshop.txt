description=[b]Justification for the changes the mod offers:[/b]
description=Fanny pack is a very light item that puts all the weight of carried items on the hips instead of the spine. It should therefore be better than a backpack in terms of carrying weight. Vanilla stats (weight = 1 and weight reduction of 7%) are a joke from this perspective, as the item adds 0.8 (!!!) net weight if you want to use it. And it is very handy to be able to separate the stuff always carried on your missions from the gathered loot. My selection of items carried in the fanny pack is: bangdages, disinfectant, some pills, hammer and screwdriver. What is yours?
